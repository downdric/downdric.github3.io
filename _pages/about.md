<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a second year Master student from School of CS, Nankai University. I received my Master degree at Xidian University in 2021. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jufeng Yang of Computer Vision Lab.

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particularly focusing on image-text multi-modal learning, semantix segmentation and label distribution learning.
